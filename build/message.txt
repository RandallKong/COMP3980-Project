Welcome to the Example Text File!

This file contains several lines of text,
demonstrating how text files can be read
line by line in many programming languages.

Each line is separated by a newline character,
which is typically represented as '\n' in code.

Some lines are short.
Others might be a bit longer, demonstrating variability.

End of the example file.
